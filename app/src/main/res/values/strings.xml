    <string name="game_info">In a galaxy far, far away Tara B, on the ancient planet of Lengaburu, a tale unfolds that echoes through the annals of time. After the recent war with neighbouring planet Falicornia, King Shan has exiled the Queen of Falicornia for 15 years.

\n\nQueen Al Falcone is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find her before the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15 yearsâ€¦.

\n\nKing Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, Sapir, Lerbin &amp; Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal &amp; can send his army to only 4 of these planets.

\n\nNow you being King Shan you have to find Queen Al Falcone.
